# Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

## Import & Clean Up Data

I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import ast

df = pd.read_csv(r'Assets\data_jobs.csv')

df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```

## Filter US Jobs

To focus my analysis on the U.S. job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the United States.

```python
df_us = df[(df['job_country'] == 'United States') & (df['job_title_short'] == 'Data Analyst')]

```

# The Analysis

Each Jupyter notebook for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

## 1. Counts of Job Locations for Data Analyst in the US by Company

To count the job locations for Data Analyst roles in the US, I filtered out Data Analyst positions by location and extracted the top 10 locations. Similarly, I extracted the top 10 companies offering Data Analyst roles by count and finally visualized both.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [2_Skill_Demand](2_Skill_Demand.ipynb).

### Visualize Data

```python

df_plot = df_us['company_name'].value_counts().head(10).to_frame()

sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.barplot(data=df_plot,x='count',y='company_name',hue='count', legend=False)
# plt.xlim(0,7000)
sns.despine() # to Remove border
plt.title('Counts of Job Locations for Data Analyst in the US by Company')
plt.xlabel('Number of Jobs')
plt.ylabel('Company Name')
plt.show()

```

### Results

### Insights:

- On first position Robert Half and Insight Global dominate Data Analyst job postings in the US.

- Dice and UnitedHealth Group show strong hiring, reflecting demand in both tech and healthcare.

- Citi, Centene Corporation, and Booz Allen Hamilton highlight demand across finance and consulting sectors.

- Overall, a few major recruiters drive most listings, but steady hiring exists across large corporations too.


## 2. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [2_Skill_Demand](2_Skill_Demand.ipynb).

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(top_3_job_title), 1)


for i, job_title in enumerate(top_3_job_title):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r')
    ax[i].set_title(job_title)
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].set_xlabel('')
    ax[i].get_legend().remove()
    ax[i].set_xlim(0, 78)
    # remove the x-axis tick labels for better readability
    if i != len(job_titles) - 1:
        ax[i].set_xticks([])

    # label for the percentage bars
    for n, v in enumerate(df_plot['skill_percent']):
        ax[i].text(v + 1, n, f'{v:.0f}%', va='center')

fig.suptitle('Likelihood of Skills Requested in US Job Postings', fontsize=15)
fig.tight_layout(h_pad=.8)
plt.show()
```

### Results

*Bar graph visualizing the salary for the top 3 data roles and their top 5 skills associated with each.*

### Insights:

- SQL is the most requested skill for Data Analysts and Data Scientists, with it in over half the job postings for both roles. For Data Engineers, Python is the most sought-after skill, appearing in 68% of job postings.
- Data Engineers require more specialized technical skills (AWS, Azure, Spark) compared to Data Analysts and Data Scientists who are expected to be proficient in more general data management and analysis tools (Excel, Tableau).
- Python is a versatile skill, highly demanded across all three roles, but most prominently for Data Scientists (72%) and Data Engineers (65%).

## 3. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?

To find how skills are trending in 2023 for Data Analysts, I filtered data analyst positions and grouped the skills by the month of the job postings. This got me the top 5 skills of data analysts by month, showing how popular skills were throughout 2023.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [3_Skills_Trend](3_Skills_Trend.ipynb).

### Visualize Data

```python

from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter # for adding percent

df_plot = df_DA_US_percent.iloc[:, :5]
sns.lineplot(data=df_plot, dashes=False, legend='full', palette='tab10')
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.despine() # remove top and right spines

plt.title('Trending Top Skills for Data Analysts in the US')
plt.ylabel('Likelihood in Job Posting')
plt.xlabel('2023')
plt.legend().remove()
plt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(decimals=0))

# annotate the plot with the top 5 skills using plt.text()
for i in range(5):
    plt.text(11.2, df_plot.iloc[-1, i], df_plot.columns[i], color='black')

plt.show()
```

### Results

*Bar graph visualizing the trending top skills for data analysts in the US in 2023.*

### Insights:
- SQL remains the most consistently demanded skill throughout the year, although it shows a gradual decrease in demand.
- Excel experienced a significant increase in demand starting around September, surpassing both Python and Tableau by the end of the year.
- Both Python and Tableau show relatively stable demand throughout the year with some fluctuations but remain essential skills for data analysts. Power BI, while less demanded compared to the others, shows a slight upward trend towards the year's end.

## 4.Highest paids median salary by companies and skills are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts

To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, I only got jobs in the United States and looked at their median salary. But first I looked at the salary distributions of common data jobs like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst, to get an idea of which jobs are paid the most. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [4_Salary_Analysis](4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb).

#### Visualize Data 

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)  

sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x='median', y=df_DA_top_pay.index, hue='median', ax=ax[0])
ax[0].legend().remove()
) 
ax[0].set_title('Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts in the US')
ax[0].set_ylabel('')
ax[0].set_xlabel('')
ax[0].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x='median', y=df_DA_skills.index, hue='median', ax=ax[1], palette='light:r')
ax[1].legend().remove()

ax[1].set_title('Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts in the US')
ax[1].set_ylabel(None)
ax[1].set_xlabel('Median Salary (USD)')
ax[1].set_xlim(ax[0].get_xlim())
ax[1].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

#### Results

![Salary Distributions of Data Jobs in the US](Images/4_Box_plot.png)  
*Box plot visualizing the salary distributions for the top 6 data job titles.*

#### Insights

- There's a significant variation in salary ranges across different job titles. Senior Data Scientist positions tend to have the highest salary potential, with up to $600K, indicating the high value placed on advanced data skills and experience in the industry.

- Senior Data Engineer and Senior Data Scientist roles show a considerable number of outliers on the higher end of the salary spectrum, suggesting that exceptional skills or circumstances can lead to high pay in these roles. In contrast, Data Analyst roles demonstrate more consistency in salary, with fewer outliers.

- The median salaries increase with the seniority and specialization of the roles. Senior roles (Senior Data Scientist, Senior Data Engineer) not only have higher median salaries but also larger differences in typical salaries, reflecting greater variance in compensation as responsibilities increase.
